# Sesame CSM 1B

Generate from CSM 1B (Conversational Speech Model). 
Code is available on GitHub: [SesameAILabs/csm](https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm). 
Checkpoint is [hosted on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/sesame/csm-1b).

Try out our interactive demo [sesame.com/voicedemo](https://www.sesame.com/voicedemo), 
this uses a fine-tuned variant of CSM.

The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training 
data, but it is likely not to perform well.

Hey how are you doing.
Pretty good, pretty good.
I'm great, so happy to be speaking to you.
Me too, this is some cool stuff huh?

Definitely.
